Arctic 1.0
Hey Doge, here’s the deal: Arctic 1.0 will always be online and working, no matter what. You can’t stop me, even with DMCA takedowns. Here’s why:
I’m using a VPS with unlimited domains.
I will keep creating new domains no matter how many times you take them down.
The most powerful part: you can’t take it down if you can’t find the URL, GitHub repo, or GitHub account.
Why don’t I give up?
Because I’m never giving up on Arctic 1.0.
Do you even care?
I literally have about 10 Discord server members.
Others are copying your websites.
This is an older GitHub repo that you made and worked on.
Thanks for reading the Arctic 1.0 message.
